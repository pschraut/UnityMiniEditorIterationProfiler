# Mini Editor Iteration Profiler for Unity

The Mini Editor Iteration Profiler shows the duration the Unity editor needs to:
* Compile assemblies
* Perform an assembly reload
* Enter Play Mode
* Exit Play Mode

These timings are shown in the Scene and GameView, using Unity's EditorWindow [notifications API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorWindow.ShowNotification.html) and are presented in the simplest way possible.

Easy access to these timings allows you to spot whenever one of those timings worsened, which should be a signal to check what you recently added to the project, that would explain the drop in performance.

I use this tool for a long time, it proved quite useful.
It allowed me to witness how Unity upgrades affect performance of my editor iteration time and to become immediately 
aware if my code changes added another second to enter Play Mode for example. Especially enter Play Mode can worsen significantly over 
time if you don't have an eye on it. The Mini Editor Iteration Profiler shows you the duration every time you enter Play Mode, which makes it difficult to let things go unnoticed.

Use Unity's Preferences window to configure what timings to show.

# Installation

In order to use the Mini Editor Iteration Profiler, you have to add the package to your project. As of Unity 2019.3, Unity supports to add packages from git through the Package Manager window.

In Unity's Package Manager, choose "Add package from git URL" and insert one of the Package URL's you can find below.


## Package URL's

I recommend to right-click the URL below and choose "Copy Link" rather than selecting the text and copying it, because sometimes it copies a space at the end and the Unity Package Manager can't handle it and spits out an error when you try to add the package.
